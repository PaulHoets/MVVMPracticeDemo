# MVVMPracticeDemo
MVVM Practice Demo, based off the example taught by Houssem Dellai in his YouTube video.

He gives an excellent overview on how you would begin an MVVM styled app, how you might scale it, and finally, he shows how you can use the power of MVVM to make easy to run unit tests.

Thank you for your hard work Houseem!
